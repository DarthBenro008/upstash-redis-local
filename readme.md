# upstash-redis-local

> A local webserver for testing and development using [`@upstash/redis`](https://github.com/upstash/upstash-redis)

## ü§î upstash-redis-local?

The `upstash-redis-local` command is used to initiate a local web server, serving a REST API compatible with [Upstash REST Api](https://docs.upstash.com/redis/features/restapi), in front of a real Redis database instance. This setup is intended for testing purposes.

This project is inspired by [upstashdis](https://github.com/mna/upstashdis) but uses `fasthttp` instead for better performance and provides some better logging along with a docker image, and build release!

## üíª Usage

```bash
upstash-redis-local v1.0
A local server that mimics upstash-redis for local testing purposes!

       * Connect to any local redis of your choice for testing
